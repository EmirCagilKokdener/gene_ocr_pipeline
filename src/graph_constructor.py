def build_graph_from_kgml(index_by_entry: dict, xml_path: str) -> nx.DiGraph:
    """
    Construct a directed graph from the <relation> elements in a KGML file.

    Each relation in the KGML specifies an interaction between two entries
    (e.g., genes or compounds). This function builds a NetworkX DiGraph
    whose nodes correspond to the provided entry IDs and whose edges
    correspond to relations between entries that were successfully matched.

    Parameters
    ----------
    index_by_entry : dict
        A mapping from KGML entry ID (string) to its index in the matched
        gene list. Only entry IDs present here will be included as nodes.
    xml_path : str
        Filesystem path to the KGML (XML) file.

    Returns
    -------
    nx.DiGraph
        A directed graph in which nodes are entry IDs (as strings) and
        edges represent directed relations (entry1 â†’ entry2).
